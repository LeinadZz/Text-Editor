# Text-Editor

In this challenge I create a text editor that runs in your browser. This a progressive web application that features many data persistence techniques that server as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. This application will also function offline.

## User Story

    AS A developer
    I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
    SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
